#KRITI

```This app is not for production, but only for demonstration of my understanding of container and container orchestration```

/kriti : This is container creator and orchestrator (analogous to kubernetes and docker).
/app   : This the app which is containerized and deployed.

```
##Container
chroot with isolation (process and network) with explicitly exposed network ports.
```

```
##Orchestrator
Deploys and monitors a collection of containers (pods) on to different machines.
```

```
##config.json
Defines structure of deployment. It is a sample which contains all possible directives kriti can handle.
```
